                  Eleos was born from a quiet ache; a longing to bridge the gap
                  between suffering and support. For years, we watched people
                  silently unravel under the weight of unspoken trauma,
                  addiction, chronic illness, burnout, grief, and hormonal
                  changes that shook the core of their identity.
                </Typography>

                <Typography>
                  We saw mothers break in private, teens spiral without a
                  lifeline, employees buckle under silent workplace stress, and
                  families collapse without the tools to heal.
                </Typography>

                <Typography>
                  So we came together; a small circle of passionate therapists,
                  nutritionists, faith-led healers, and wellness advocates,
                  bound by a shared dream to build something sacred. A place
                  where healing is intentional, restoration is holistic, and no
                  one is ever treated as just a "case."
                </Typography>

                <Box
                  sx={{
                    textAlign: "center",

                  Here, science meets soul. Therapy meets tenderness. Detox
                  meets daily prayer. And healing is not a privilege; it's a
                  right we protect with everything we have.
